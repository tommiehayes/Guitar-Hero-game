# Guitar-Hero-game
INSTRUCTIONS
To begin the game the mouse has to be pressed. Once the game has begun the
timer will start counting to 30 seconds. There are two players and each
player uses three keys each. Player 1 uses A, S and D, while Player 2 
uses J, K, and L. A blue ball on each side will start falling down at a
random speed and will fall into 1 of 3 lanes in each players screen. It
is the player's objective to press the right key when the blue ball 
reaches the green box, and to avoid the ball hitting the red box (this
game is based on Guitar Hero). The player will gain a point if the correct
key is pressed at the correct time and if the player can get 5 points
without letting a ball hit the red, then their multiplier will go up by
one and they will start earning more points for each ball. The game ends 
at 30 seconds and the winner will appear on the screen. The mouse can 
then be pressed to play again. 

VISUAL DESIGN
Colours are used to show where the ball should and shouldn't be. Colours
are also used to show that time is running out as the timer gradually
turns from green to red.  Also the use of lanes makes it easier for 
the player to figure out which key to press. The design of the whole 
game is also very simplistic and you get all the information you need in 
one spot.
